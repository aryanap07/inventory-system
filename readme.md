📦 Introduction

This is a personal inventory management project built to explore real-world backend concepts and database-driven applications. The goal was to move beyond basic tutorials and create something practical that solves a real problem — managing stock in a small workshop or spare-parts environment.

The system replaces manual record-keeping with a simple digital workflow where inward and outward stock can be tracked reliably. It focuses on clean logic, data validation, and structured code design rather than a flashy interface.

This project connects to a private Supabase database and is intended for learning and demonstration purposes only. It reflects my approach to building practical systems that are simple, functional, and grounded in real use cases.
